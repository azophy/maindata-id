          MainData.id aims to make public data in Indonesia more accessible and useful for everyone.
          We believe that by simplifying the process of finding, understanding, and querying government data,
          we can empower citizens, researchers, and policymakers to derive valuable insights and make
          data-driven decisions. Our goal is to transform raw data into a readily usable resource that
          fosters transparency and innovation.

          This project is an experimental endeavor, primarily serving as a learning platform for exploring
          frontend development, AI-assisted coding techniques, and the broader field of AI product development.
          It is developed with an open-source spirit, and we encourage others to explore the codebase, learn
          from it, and contribute to its evolution. We hope it can be a helpful resource for those interested
          in similar technologies and the potential of open data.
